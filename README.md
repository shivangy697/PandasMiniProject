This project demonstrates the use of Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. Through this small project, I aimed to enhance my understanding of key Pandas concepts, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). By working with real datasets, I learned how to efficiently handle missing values, perform aggregations, and visualize data insights. The project serves as a practical application of my skills, showcasing how Pandas can streamline data workflows and facilitate informed decision-making.
